There are 2 available algorithms for intelligent move:
1 - Stack solution (solves %100)
2 - Branch&Bound solution (without backtracking, so on stuck cases it may not be able to solve %100)
Please select the algorithm: 1


You can change number of shuffles in main.cpp
Your initial random board is

1  2  3  
7  4  6  
__ 5  8  

Your move (P for auto-solve): I
Intelligence moved right
1  2  3  
7  4  6  
5  __ 8  

Your move (P for auto-solve): I
Intelligence moved left
1  2  3  
7  4  6  
__ 5  8  

Your move (P for auto-solve): I
Intelligence moved right
1  2  3

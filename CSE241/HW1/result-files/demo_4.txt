Please enter the problem size: 3

There are 2 available algorithms for intelligent move:
1 - Stack solution (solves %100)
2 - Branch&Bound solution (without backtracking, so on stuck cases it may not be able to solve %100)
Please select the algorithm: 2


You can change number of shuffles in main.cpp
Your initial random board is

1  5  2  
4  __ 3  
7  8  6  

Your move (P for auto-solve): I
Intelligence moved up
1  __ 2  
4  5  3  
7  8  6  

Your move (P for auto-solve): I
Intelligence moved right
1  2  __ 
4  5  3  
7  8  6  

Your move (P for auto-solve): I
Intelligence moved down
1  2  3  
4  5  __ 
7  8  6  

Your move (P for auto-solve): I
Intelligence moved down
1  2  3  
4  5  6  
7  8  __ 



You win!

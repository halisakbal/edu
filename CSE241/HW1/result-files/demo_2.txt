There are 2 available algorithms for intelligent move:
1 - Stack solution (solves %100)
2 - Branch&Bound solution (without backtracking, so on stuck cases it may not be able to solve %100)
Please select the algorithm: 1


You can change number of shuffles in main.cpp
Your initial random board is

1  2  3  4  
5  6  11 7  
9  10 8  12 
13 14 15 __ 

Your move (P for auto-solve): P

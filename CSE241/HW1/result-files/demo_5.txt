There are 2 available algorithms for intelligent move:
1 - Stack solution (solves %100)
2 - Branch&Bound solution (without backtracking, so on stuck cases it may not be able to solve %100)
Please select the algorithm: 2


You can change number of shuffles in main.cpp
Your initial random board is

__ 1  2  3  
5  6  7  4  
9  10 11 8  
13 14 15 12 

Your move (P for auto-solve): P
